- 👋 Hi, I’m @Paikonia
-My real name is Patrick Aiko
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and robotics. I majorly do coding because I dont have access to most of the hardware for robotics. I am also interested in artificial intelligence.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and linux system programming and developing a web server. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building a web Server.
